# TimeSeriesAnalysis

##This Document explains the use of different approches in the Time series analysis method.
##
1.Exponential smoothing weighted moving average
2. Holt winter method
    1. Additive method
        when the seasonal component is linear in curve
    2. Multiplicative method    
        when the seasonal component curve varies so much
        
3. ACF and PACF
4. How to choose the order of ARIMA(p,d,q terms) for Stationary case and (P,D,Q) and m terms for Seasonal case
